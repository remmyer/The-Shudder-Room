          <h3><em>10.</em> Resident Evil 4 Remake</h3>
          <h4>Survival, Third-Person Shooter</h4>
          <p>Don't let the fact that this is at the bottom of the list stop you from considering it. It's only here because I'd consider it to be the least scary out of all the games here, but nonetheless, the gameplay, graphics, and story, is amazing! It definitely has it's moments of intense horror though, like the scene in the dark lab with the Regeneradors.</p>
          <p>"Survival is just the beginning. Six years have passed since the biological disaster in Raccoon City. Leon S. Kennedy, one of the survivors, tracks the president's kidnapped daughter to a secluded European village, where there is something terribly wrong with the locals."</p>

          <h4>Survival, Psychological, Third-Person</h4>
          <p>Silent Hill 3 is a continuation of the Silent Hill story through James daughter, Heather. The monsters in this game are truly horrifying, and the dark, abandoned environment only makes it scarier.</p>
          <p>"The player takes control of Heather, a 17-year-old girl who awakens from a nightmare in a shopping mall restaurant and tries to return home to her father, while navigating environments that switch between reality and the Otherworld, a bloodier, supernatural alternate world."</p>

          <h3><em>6.</em> Rule of Rose </h3>
          <h4>Survival, Psychological, Third-Person</h4>
          <p>A classic PS2 horror game that was taken off the shelves because of some misconceptions. I wish this game was known more because it features an amazing, and impactful story with it's intense moments, and characters. It's also narrated in a way that makes you feel like you're in a fairy tale.</p>
          <p>"The Plot of Rule of Rose focuses on a nineteen-year old orphan named Jennifer as she recovers the forgotten memories of her childhood and remembers the people she knew at the Rose Garden Orphanage."</p>

          <h4>Survival, Jump scare, First-Person</h4>
          <p>FNAF 4 has I'd say the most horrifying animatronic designs of all the games. You play as a child in his bedroom, and not only do you have to check for animatronics coming from each door, but also your own closet door, and behind you!</p>
          <p>"In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows."</p>

          <h4>Survival, Puzzle, Third-Person Shooter</h4>
          <p>Unlike the remake of the 4th, Resident Evil 2's horror is much more in your face, with the constant darkness, and enemies that you'll find, especially with the Tyrant, that follows you slowly throughout half of the game, constantly keeping you on your toes.</p>
          <p>"A deadly virus engulfs the residents of Raccoon City in September of 1998, plunging the city into chaos as flesh eating zombies roam the streets for survivors. An unparalleled adrenaline rush, gripping storyline, and unimaginable horrors await you. Witness the return of Resident Evil 2."</p>

          <h3><em>2.</em> Resident Evil 7: BIOHAZARD</h3>
          <h4>Survival, Psychological, FPS</h4>
          <p>Out of all the Resident Evil games, I don't think any of them can beat the horror that there is in the 7th game of the main series. The change in gameplay from third to first person, and the eery, and cramped environment of the Baker's house make this to be in my opinion the scariest of the series.</p>
          <p>"Fear and isolation seep through the walls of an abandoned southern farmhouse. "7" marks a new beginning for survival horror with the “Isolated View” of the visceral new first-person perspective."</p>

          <h3><em>1.</em> Ready Or Not</h3>
          <h4>Realistic, Tactical, FPS, Horror </h4>
          <p>Ready Or Not may not be officially classified as a horror game, but it includes something that makes this scarier than any other game on the list, <strong>realism</strong>. It tackles issues, and horrifying situations that you can't even push away as fiction because they are all things that happen in real life. What adds to the horror is that you never know when you're going to be jumped on by an enemy, and you have to be extremely careful. Some of the locations, and maps are also very dark, and can create more isolated environments which add to the game's horror.</p>
          <p>"Ready or Not is an intense, tactical, first-person shooter that depicts a modern-day world in which SWAT police units are called to defuse hostile and confronting situations."</p>
